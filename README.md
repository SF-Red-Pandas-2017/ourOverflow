 * The user stories that define our MVP.

 A site where users can post questions and other users can answer them.
Users can also comment on both questions and answers.  Like StackOverflow, the comments are displayed in a flat list.  The user who posted a question can declare one of the user-submitted answers to be the best answer.

Users can upvote and downvote questions, answers, and comments. Only one vote allowed per user for each question, answer, and comment.  Users cannot add a question, answer, or comment or vote unless they're logged in, but they can view all of the above when logged out.

Deliverables:
* Must be logged in to post
* Post question
* Post answer
* Comment on question and answer (display in flat list)
* Declare best answer
* Upvote and downvote on all - (only one vote per user)
